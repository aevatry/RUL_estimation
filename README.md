This goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of Machine Learning tools and especially Deep Learning when compared to classical methods based on statistical analysis for the task of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation of rotating machinery. The main focus of the project is on pitting damage, based on the data produced at the Tribology Grooup, Imperial COllege, using a Micro-Pitting Rig, produced by PCS Instruments.
